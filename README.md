## üöÄ Featured Projects

### üìä Data Analysis & Regression

| Projeto | Descri√ß√£o | T√©cnicas Chave |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Advanced Regressive Methods** | Demonstrates use cases in **Advanced Regression Modeling** and **Model Optimization**. Focuses on building, tuning (`GridSearchCV`), and evaluating diverse models (e.g., SVR, Gradient Boosting) for highly accurate predictive tasks. | `sklearn`, `GridSearchCV`, Ensemble Methods, MAE/MSE. |

### üß† Deep Learning & Computer Vision

| Projeto | Descri√ß√£o | T√©cnicas Chave |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Masters' Degree Vision Transformer for Planting Failure** | My biggest project, developed for my Master's research. This implements an **Image Classification** solution using a cutting-edge **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model, fine-tuned for an agricultural dataset (classifying between Plant, Soil, and Straw). The solution leverages **Transfer Learning** to achieve high classification performance. | **ViT**, **Transfer Learning**, `Hugging Face Transformers`, `PyTorch`, Image Classification. |
| **License Plate Detection (CNN)** | Details the development of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**-based solution for **License Plate Localization**. This core component of an ANPR system predicts bounding box coordinates, demonstrating proficiency in Object Detection. | **CNN**, **VGG16**, **Localization/Regression**, `Keras/TensorFlow`, IoU. |
| **GPT Nano (Character-Level)** | Focuses on building and training a simplified, custom **Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT)** model (GPT Nano) from scratch. The model is trained on the works of Shakespeare to generate text in the distinct Elizabethan style. | **Transformer Architecture**, **GPT Nano**, NLP, **Generative AI**, `PyTorch`. |
